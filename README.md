## Introduction
The **Student Complaint System** is a C++ program designed to streamline the process of complaint registration and feedback collection for students. The system enables students to register, log in, submit complaints, and provide feedback on the resolution of their issues. The project is built using object-oriented programming principles to ensure modularity, maintainability, and code reuse.

## Methodology
The project leverages several key C++ concepts:
- **Inheritance**: Establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes, allowing code reuse and logical structure. For example, the `User` class serves as a base class, with `Student` derived from it.
- **Templates**: Used to create generic functions for reading and writing data, making it easier to handle different types of objects.
- **Polymorphism**: Allows different user types to manage file I/O operations using virtual functions for flexibility.
- **File Handling**: Ensures persistent storage of user registrations and complaints, allowing data to be saved and retrieved across sessions.

## Functionality
The system provides the following features:
1. **User Registration & Login**: Allows students to register and securely log into the system.
2. **Complaint Submission**: Students can submit complaints, which are stored in text files for later review.
3. **Feedback Collection**: After complaints are resolved, students can provide feedback on the resolution process.
4. **Data Persistence**: All data, including user credentials and complaints, are stored in text files for easy access and modification.

## Sample Outputs
Below are examples of how the program interacts with users:

### Registration & Login
```plaintext
Welcome to the Student Complaint System!
1. Register
2. Login
3. Exit
Enter your choice: 1

Enter your name: John Doe
Enter your student ID: 12345
Enter your password: ******
Registration successful!

Complaint Submission
Enter your complaint: "Classroom is too cold."
Complaint submitted successfully.

Viewing Complaints (Admin)
1. Student ID: 12345
   Complaint: "Classroom is too cold."
   Status: Pending

Limitations & Future Enhancements
Current Limitations
Passwords are stored in plaintext without encryption.
Limited functionality for viewing and resolving complaints.
Basic input validation; more robust checks are needed.
No support for handling multiple simultaneous users.
Future Enhancements
Implement password encryption to enhance security.
Add user management and detailed reporting features.
Use databases instead of text files for better scalability.
Develop a graphical or web-based user interface.
Enable support for multiple simultaneous users to handle concurrency.
Technologies Used
C++: Core programming language for building the system.
Object-Oriented Programming: Leveraging classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
File Handling: To store and manage user and complaint data.

Conclusion
The Student Complaint System efficiently handles student complaints and feedback using C++ and object-oriented programming principles. Future improvements aim to enhance the system's security, scalability, and user experience.
